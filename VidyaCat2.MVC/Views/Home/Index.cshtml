        <h2>What COVID-19 Means For The Retro Game Market</h2>
        <h4>By VidyaCat HQ</h4>
        <p class="blurb">
            We all know how much the pandemic has affected the economy overall, especially restaurants and small businesses. But what about the used/retro game market? While arguably less important than the aforementioned industries, COVID-19 has certainly turned the retro game scene into a seller's market. With people spending more time at home than ever, they're bound to get bored. What better to do than to play your favorite video games from your childhood?! This mentality has seen prices for older games and consoles skyrocket as stock becomes less and less available.

        <h2>A Beginner's Guide to Collecting Video Games</h2>
        <h4>By VidyaCat HQ</h4>
        <p class="blurb">
            So you want to start collecting video games? Awesome! Here's a helpful guide to get you started. The first thing you'll want to figure out is what kind of games you're into. If you aren't very familiar with video games in general, it's best to start with something casual to learn the ropes before diving into an 80-hour JRPG that will cause you severe existential dread... Anyway, it's hard to go wrong with classic games like Super Mario Bros. or Crash Bandicoot. They'll warm you up to the coordination and timing required for many games, but can also offer a fair challenge in their later levels.

        <h2>Never Trust The Disembodied Voice</h2>
        <h4>By VidyaCat HQ</h4>
        <p class="blurb">
            Just like movies, video games have their tropes that can seem almost inescapable at times. If you've seen enough horror movies, you can probably guess who lives and dies within the first 15 minutes of most of them. If you're a rom-com fan, you know that the guy and girl who have completely different lives will end up together. And, unfortunately, if you like story-based games, you probably know by now that the mysterious voice who talks to you at the beginning of the game and guides you through the early levels is almost sure to be the final boss of the game, after the owner of the voice turns on you.
